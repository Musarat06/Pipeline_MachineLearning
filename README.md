# Pipeline_MachineLearning
Logistic Regression model and Decision Tree classifier using Pipelines. 

In this analysis, I have trained logistic regression and decision tree classifier models on breast cancer data using the Pipeline form sklearn library. I have also normalized data for logistic regression model as it assumes normal distribution before the training model.
